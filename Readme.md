# Pokemon Card Lister
This project was created to help with listing a large amount of individual Pokemon Cards on eBay in a timely manner.

## About
The eBay-provided samples for using the .NET SDK were used to make this project.
An Excel Spreadsheet is used to keep track of all of the cards. This sheet holds all of the information about each card.
Pictures are added to each listing by uploading them to EPS before attaching them to each card Listing. 

#### Disclaimer
This project is designed soley for personal use. It has several dependancies that rely on my specific machine set-up.
